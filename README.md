# Melt-Pool-Dimension-Estimation
Melt Pool Dimension Estimation – Additive Manufacturing (LPBF)
This project aims to predict melt pool dimensions (length, width, depth) in Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing using machine learning techniques.

🔍 Overview
The goal was to explore how alloy composition and process parameters influence melt pool geometry. Due to the limited dataset size, a traditional machine learning approach was used instead of deep learning to avoid overfitting.

Key steps include:

Data collection from publicly available sources

Cleaning and preprocessing of alloy composition and process parameter data

Feature correlation analysis

Model training 

Evaluation using R² scores on different dimensions

📈 Results Summary
Built an initial predictive model with promising performance on training data ( R² scores: Length – 0.98, Width – 0.96, Depth – 0.75).

Disclaimer:
None of the data used in this project was experimentally generated by me. All datasets were gathered from publicly available sources and research publications. My contribution was limited to cleaning, processing, and analyzing this data for academic purposes.
